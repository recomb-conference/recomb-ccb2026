<h4>Contributions</h4>

RECOMB-CCB 2026 welcomes contributions in all areas of computational cancer biology. Contributions can follow several distinct formats (from papers to posters), and each track has its own deadline.
<br>
<br>

<h6>Deadline: March 13, 2026</h6>
<ul>
<li>Paper track: full papers reporting on original research (both theoretical and experimental).</li>
</ul>
<h6>Deadline: March 20, 2026</h6>
<ul>
<li>Late Breaking Research track: abstracts on unpublished research;</li>
<li>Highlights track: highlights of high-impact research published since January 1, 2025;</li>
<li>Posters track: posters describing unpublished or recently-published work</li>
</ul>
<h6>Author notification: April 10, 2026</h6>
<ul>
<li>For all submitted contributions; notifications of acceptance will be sent by email.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Topics of Interest</h4>
<p>
RECOMB-CCB 2026 welcomes submissions in areas including, but not limited to:
  
<ul>
<li>Cancer genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics</li>
<li>Single-cell and spatial sequencing technologies</li>
<li>Multi-omics data integration</li>
<li>Tumor microenvironment, immunogenomics, and immunotherapy</li>
<li>Cancer evolution and clonal dynamics</li>
<li>Mathematical and mechanistic modeling of cancer</li>
<li>Statistical modeling, machine learning, and AI methods in oncology</li>
<li>Functional and systems cancer biology</li>
<li>Digital pathology and imaging-based computational analysis</li>
</ul>

We particularly encourage submissions that leverage high-dimensional molecular data 
— including genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, single-cell, 
spatial, and imaging modalities — to address fundamental questions in cancer biology 
and oncology. The meeting emphasizes rigorous computational methodology — 
including statistical modeling, algorithmic development, evolutionary modeling, and AI-
driven approaches — alongside biologically and clinically grounded applications that 
yield mechanistic insight into cancer initiation, progression, clonal evolution, and 
therapeutic response. We especially welcome contributions that couple methodological 
innovation with deep biological interpretation, advancing our understanding of cancer 
systems across scales — from genetic alterations and clonal dynamics to tumor 
ecosystems and clinical translation. Submissions may focus on theoretical advances, 
integrative multi-omics frameworks, evolutionary and mechanistic modeling, or 
computational studies grounded in biological and clinical relevance. 
</p>
  
<h4>Full Papers</h4>
<p>
Submissions should represent original, previously unpublished work. 
<p>
The Program Committee will rigorously review submitted papers, and selected papers will be accepted for presentation at the conference. Authors of accepted papers must submit the full paper to a preprint server (arXiv, bioRxiv, or medRxiv) by <b>May 1, 2026</b> to ensure that the presented paper is accessible.
<p>
<b>Manuscript format.</b> A manuscript should start with a succinct statement of the problem, the results achieved, their significance, and a comparison with previous work. This material should be understandable to non-specialists. A technical exposition directed to the specialist should follow. The length, excluding cover page, bibliography, and appendix, should not exceed 10 pages. The manuscript should be easy to read, using at least 10 point font size on U.S. standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper with no less than one inch margin all around. If the authors believe that more details are absolutely necessary to substantiate the claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix, or supplementary data, which might be read at the discretion of the reviewers. An email address for the contact author should be included. Manuscripts that deviate significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
<!--
<p>
<b>Post-conference PLOS Computational Biology publication.</b> All full-paper submissions to RECOMB-CCB will be considered for publication in PLOS Computational Biology. Authors will be notified of whether their paper is accepted for oral presentation at RECOMB-CCB and simultaneously whether it is being considered for expedited review by PLOS Computational Biology on <b>TBA</b>. Note that PLOS Computational Biology requires that a manuscript has both computational merit and clear and novel biological significance. The journal is Open Access and requires authors to pay publication charges. In addition to the RECOMB CCB reviewers, the Editors of PLOS Computational Biology, as well as potentially 1-2 additional reviewers with particular knowledge of the biological applications addressed, will be actively engaged in those RECOMB CCB accepted papers being considered for PLOS Computational Biology.
-->
<p>
<b>Parallel submissions.</b> If a full paper is submitted to the Paper track for oral presentation at RECOMB-CCB the authors can simultaneously submit the full paper to a journal of their choice. Note that papers accepted to RECOMB-CCB must be submitted to a preprint server (e.g., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv) by <b>May 1, 2026</b>.
<p>
<b>Special handling of papers submitted to RECOMB 2026.</b> Papers that were previously reviewed and rejected by RECOMB 2026 can be submitted to RECOMB-CCB and reviewed as revised papers. To submit a revision, please include the reviews received from RECOMB together with a point-by-point response describing the revisions made to the manuscript and how these revisions address the concerns raised by the reviewers. All reviews will be treated confidentially and will only be visible to the PC members evaluating your paper. Please note that acceptance to RECOMB-CBB is not guaranteed, even if you have revised your submission. All papers, including those submitted directly to either satellite meeting, will be equally evaluated on the basis of scientific quality, technical novelty and level of interest to the respective community.

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<p>
Submission should be abstracts (up to 1-page) that describe the computational contributions of papers that have been published in a journal after <b>January 1, 2025</b>, or papers that are “in press” at the time of submission and are already linked on the journal web-site. <b>Please indicate in the abstract that your submission is for the highlights/late breaking research track.</b>
<p>
The papers will be selected for presentation by taking into consideration the impact of the work on the field, the likelihood that the work will make a good presentation and the relevance to biological and biomedical research in general. Please visit RECOMB 2026 EasyChair server to submit your abstract to the appropriate track. Submissions must contain an abstract (1-page abstract, plain justified text in 10pt character size, formatted to fit US Letter paper 8.5in x 11in, including title, author(s), affiliation, e-mail, the identity of the presenter (in case of a multi-authored paper), followed by the abstract text). Abstracts lacking this information will not be considered. 
<p>
Accepted presenters for the Late Breaking Research or Highlight tracks are required to make the presentation themselves and must register and pay to attend the conference.

<h4>Posters (and Very Short Lightning Talks)</h4>
<p>
RECOMB-CCB 2026 invites the submission of abstracts of your work for presentation in a poster session. 
<p>
The poster can describe existing published or “in press” research or can describe new work. Submissions must contain an abstract (about 200 words, plain justified text in 10pt character size, formatted to fit A4: 21 x 29.7 cm, including title, author(s), affiliation, e-mail, a link to the published journal version (if any), and the identity of the presenter (in case of a multi-authored poster), followed by the abstract text). 
<p>
The program committee will select some of these abstracts for very short lightning talks.

<h4>Submission Procedures and Notification</h4>
<p>
Submission of papers to RECOMB-CCB 2026 will be through the EasyChair conference system by selecting the RECOMB-CCB track. The submission system will be open starting <b>February 11, 2026</b> and ending <b>March 20, 2026</b> 23:59 AoE time.
<p>
The Program Committee, chaired by Hatice U. Osmanbeyoglu (University of Pittsburgh) and Peter Van Loo (University of British Columbia) will referee the conference submissions. 
<p>
Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by email on <b>April 10, 2026</b>. An author of each accepted submission (paper, abstract, highlight, poster) is expected to attend the conference and present the paper; in case of unexpected circumstances, alternative arrangements, approved by the conference chair, should be made to have the paper presented.
